Quantum-Based Global Image Deletion System ⚛️🖼️

Global, Permanent & Verifiable Image Deletion Using Quantum Search + Binary Fingerprinting

This project implements a patented technology that enables global deletion of digital images, even after they have been shared, edited, screenshotted, or distributed across different platforms. The system assigns each image a Unique Identifier (UID) at creation and uses Quantum Search + Binary Fingerprinting to track and detect all replicas—including modified or AI-generated versions.

Unlike traditional deletion systems that work only inside one app or device, this system enforces irreversible visual blocking at the display-driver level, making the image impossible to open or view anywhere.

🚀 Features

🔍 Quantum-Enhanced Image Detection

Identifies original, modified, screenshot, and AI-generated versions using UID + binary fingerprinting.

🌐 Global Deletion Enforcement

Instantly blocks the image across all connected devices and platforms through the Quantum Deletion Protocol.

🔗 Device Chain Tracking

Maps the complete sharing path of an image:
Device A → Device B → Device C → ...

🖼️ Deepfake & Replica Identification

Detects manipulated, resized, compressed, or recolored versions of the same image.

🧠 Secure UID Assignment

Generates a tamper-proof identity using:
pHash + metadata + timestamp + origin tag.

📄 Deletion Certificate

Provides verifiable proof that the image has been removed from all detected devices.

🧪 How It Works

Stage 1: Image receives a UID + fingerprint at creation.
Stage 2: Quantum search scans global datasets for replicas.
Stage 3: System reconstructs sharing chain.
Stage 4: Quantum Deletion Protocol blocks all visual rendering.

📄 Patent Information

Title: Quantum-Based Global Image Deletion System Using Binary Fingerprinting
Inventors: Shivanshu, Shivam, Pranjal
Patent Type: Indian Patent (Filed)
Form-2: Included in repository

💡 Why This System?

As images spread instantly across apps, servers, screenshots, and AI tools, users lose all control. This system restores digital ownership, prevents misuse, and enables global deletion—something no existing technology offers.
